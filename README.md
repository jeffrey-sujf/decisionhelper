### The Concept
Inspired by the simple act of writing choices on slips of paper and drawing one at random, this app provides a clean, tactile, and delightful digital experience. Add your options, give your phone a shake, and let chance decide!

### Key Features
Intuitive Interface: A clean, minimalist design with a vintage typewriter aesthetic.

Shake to Draw: The core feature! Simply shake your mobile device to draw a random choice. You can also click the button, of course.

Multi-Language Support: The app fully supports Unicode, so you can write your choices in English, CJK, or any other language.

Persistent Choices: Your list of options is automatically saved in your browser's local storage, so they'll be waiting for you the next time you visit.

### How to Use
Add Your Choices: Type any option into the input box and click "Add".

Draw a Note: Click the "Draw a Note" button or, just give your phone a little shake! (For IOS users: click the "Draw a Note" button to give access!)

Accept or Decline:

Accept: The choice is made, and the note is removed from the current session.

Put Back: Return the note to the pool and draw again.

### Structure
HTML: For the core structure.
CSS: For modern and responsive styling.
JavaScript: To power all the interactive logic, animations, and the shake-detection feature.
